          <p><u><b>Butter & Kaya Toast</b></u><br>
            Kaya is famous throughout Malaysia, Singapore and other <br>Southeast Asia where pandan,
            the star ingredient, grows as<br> a tropical plant with palm-like leaves. Kaya jam is made
             with<br> fresh pandan, coconut milk, palm sugar and lots of eggs, which<br> make it creamy.

             Butter-Kaya toast - Made of kaya, bread, and<br> butter. Kaya is homemade by the GaoGao
             family with 20 years<br> of history.<br><br>

             Imagine warm and crispy toasted bread, slathered with a nice<br>layer of aromatic kaya
             jam (Malaysian coconut egg jam), and<br> complete with a thin slice of cold butter. As
             you hold the kaya toast <br>in your hand, the warmth of the freshly toasted bread melts the
             butter <br>inside, and as you sink your teeth into the bread, the kaya jam and the<br> butter come
             ooze out of the bread. </p></div>
